## 📊 Excel Format

Your `results.xlsx` should contain one sheet per semester (e.g. `Sem 1-1`, `Sem 1-2`, ...) plus a `Summary` sheet. Each semester sheet has one block of columns per subject:

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| Code | Subject Code |
| Subject Name | Subject Name |
| Int. | Internal Marks |
| Ext. | External Marks |
| Total | Total Marks |
| Grade | Grade (O, A+, A, B+, B, C, F, Ab) |
| Cr. | Subject Credits |

The `Summary` sheet holds `RollNumber`, `Name`, and `Branch` for every student, used to resolve student details across all semesters.

## 🧮 SGPA & CGPA Formula

- **SGPA** = Σ(Grade Point × Credits) ÷ Σ(Credits) — per semester
- **CGPA** = Σ(Semester SGPA × Semester Credits) ÷ Σ(Total Credits) — all semesters

SGPA is only calculated if the student has passed all subjects in that semester (no F or Ab grades). CGPA is only calculated if all semesters are passed. If a student has no record for a semester, it's shown as **"Not Applied for Exams"** instead of being skipped silently.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **Streamlit** — web framework
- **Pandas** — data processing
- **OpenPyXL** — Excel file parsing
- **Plotly** — interactive charts
- **ReportLab** — PDF report generation
